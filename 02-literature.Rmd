# Review of the Literature {#review}

<!--
The {#review} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 2. Look for the reference to this label at the beginning of Chapter 3. These labels will automatically be generated (if not specified) by changing the spaces to hyphens and capital letters to lowercase. For example, if it weren't specified here, the label would be '#review-of-the-literature'.

This is where you will review the literature.

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
 Floats are things like tables and figures. It is useful to inlcude this at the end of each chapter. -->
