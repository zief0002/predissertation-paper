# Results

This chapter includes your analyses and results. It should include:

- General data analysis and results
- Data results specific to each hypothesis are presented
- Chapter review


## Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No need for you to remember! So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist. You'll see their use below.

<!--
One thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function. If you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>

If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.
-->


In the **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `goldy.png` in our `figures` directory. We then give it the caption of "Goldy rendered as a pencil drawing.", the label of "goldy", and specify that this is a figure. Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

```{r goldy, fig.cap="Goldy rendered as a pencil drawing."}
include_graphics(path = "figures/goldy.png")
```

Here is a reference to the Goldy image: Figure \@ref(fig:goldy). Note the use of the `fig:` code here. By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

Notice the figure was floated to the top of the page. To override this, we use the chunk option `pos="H"`. That will override the float and place the figure exactly where the code chunk is.


```{r goldy2, fig.cap="Goldy still rendered as a pencil drawing. This time we overrode the float using the 'H' option.", fig.pos="H"}
include_graphics(path = "figures/goldy.png")
```

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics). (Note that we've shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.

```{r delaysboxplot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Delays by Airline", fig.width=6}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%
 summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
 geom_bar(position = "identity", stat = "identity", fill = "red")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
 Floats are things like tables and figures. -->

## Citations

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].



## Footnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something. ^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. 

## Bibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. Some Zotero documentation is at http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero. In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/.

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (http://pandoc.org/) to build its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol. For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying: [@Molina1994]. This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder. This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder. 

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see (http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html)^[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic: _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style files at https://www.zotero.org/styles. Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

**Tips for Bibliographies**

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. 
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
