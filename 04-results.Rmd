# Results

This chapter includes your analyses and results. It should include:

- General data analysis and results
- Data results specific to each hypothesis are presented
- Chapter review


Here is a figure of Goldy.

```{r goldy2, fig.cap="Goldy still rendered as a pencil drawing. This time we overrode the float using the 'H' option.", fig.pos="H"}
include_graphics(path = "figures/goldy.png")
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
 Floats are things like tables and figures. It is useful to inlcude this at the end of each chapter. -->
